For this assignment I have used object oriented programming to create a pharmacy inventory management system. The user can add information like product name, manufacturer, expiration date, quantity and also add if the product/medicine requires a prescription or not. Each product needs a unique id which I did my using the date.now method. The id will render in the table underneath. I have used OOP inheritance by making regularMedicine and prescriptionMedicine as sub-classes to the medicine class. The website has a structured modern layout.
